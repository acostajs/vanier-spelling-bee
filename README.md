# Vanier Spelling Bee

This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Web Programming Techniques** course at **Vanier College**.

It is a spelling bee game inspired by *The New York Times* Spelling Bee, built with **React** and **Bun**. The goal of the project is to practice modern front-end development concepts through a small but complete interactive application.

## Project Focus

The application emphasizes:
- State management using React state
- Extensive use of React hooks
- Component-based architecture
- Interactive user input and game logic
- Clean, readable front-end code

## Tech Stack

- **React** – UI development and state management  
- **Bun** – JavaScript runtime and development tooling
